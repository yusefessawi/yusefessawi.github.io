This project is a result of my participation in an intern hackathon (Appian Intern Hackathon Summer'23) where I developed a memory-efficient log analytics solution. The project leverages algorithms and data structures like dynamic programming and prefix trees to efficiently handle large volumes of log data while minimizing memory consumption. This innovative approach earned the project first place in the hackathon, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential impact in the field of log analytics.

### Key Features
- Memory Efficiency: The core strength of this project lies in its ability to handle extensive log data sets with minimal memory usage. This is achieved through the utilization of memory-efficient algorithms and data structures.

- Dynamic Programming: By applying dynamic programming techniques, the project optimizes resource allocation and computation for log analysis, ensuring that memory usage remains at a minimum while still delivering high-quality results.

- Prefix Trees: The incorporation of prefix trees (Trie data structures) facilitates efficient log searching and retrieval operations. This enhances the overall speed and accuracy of log analytics.

- Scalability: The project is designed to scale effortlessly with increasing data volumes, making it suitable for organizations dealing with substantial log data from various sources.

### Use Cases
- Large-scale Log Analysis: Organizations with extensive log data can utilize this project to analyze logs without worrying about memory constraints.
- Analysis of any overlapping data (Prefix trees are best suited for overlapping data-sets)

### Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have ideas for improvements or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can continue to enhance the capabilities of this memory-efficient log analytics solution.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers of the intern hackathon for providing the opportunity to work on this project. Additionally, I want to thank my teammates for their support and collaboration throughout the hackathon.
