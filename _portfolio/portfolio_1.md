Real estate is one of my favorite hobbies outside of course-work!

 This predictor estimates residential real estate prices and minimizes average error to 13% by leveraging a k-nearest-neighbor model. Machine-learning concepts such as hill-climbing help fine tune critical parameters and minimize error. Data for this model was extracted using the zillow API on rapid API. 

The beauty of this model is its pragmatism. It predicts the value of a property by finding the most similar properties in terms of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, location, etc., without relying on previous price history. This data-driven approach takes the emphasis off of formal appraisals and provides an open-source tool to be used by anyone. Learn more about the inspiration behind this project through its [README.md](https://github.com/yusefessawi/RealEstate/)!
