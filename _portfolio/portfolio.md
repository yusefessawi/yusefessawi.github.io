Real estate is one of my favorite hobbies outside of course-work!

 This predictor estimates residential real estate prices and minimizes average error to 13% by leveraging a k-nearest neighbor model and machine-learning concepts such as hill-climbing to fine tune critical parameters. Data for this model was extracted using the zillow API on rapid API. 

The beauty of this model is its pragmatism. It predicts the value of a property by finding the most similar properties in terms of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, location, etc., without relying on previous price history. This is data-driven approach that takes the emphasis off of formal appraisals and provides an open-source tool to be used by anyone.
