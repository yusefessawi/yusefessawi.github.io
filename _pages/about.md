Welcome! I am Yusef Essawi, a Computer Science Student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia (UVA)](https://www.virginia.edu/). I am currently in my fourth year, and have been an undergraduate research assistant and Algorithms teaching assistant in the Computer Science Department at UVA.

## About Me:
Iâ€™m interested in software development and enjoy collaborating with others on software projects! My research focuses on static analyses of python binaries using algorithmic techniques and data structures, specifically control-flow-graphs.
